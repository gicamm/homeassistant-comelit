# Comelit SimpleHome/Vedo integration for Home Assistant

With Comelit SimpleHome/Vedo integration, you can connect your Home Assistant instance to Comelit Simple Home and Vedo systems.

For more information, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/gicamm/homeassistant-comelit/wiki).

### Installation

Copy this folder to `<config_dir>/custom_components/comelit/`.

Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Comelit Hub/Vedo
comelit:
  hub:
    host: HUB IP ADDRES
    port: 1883
    mqtt-user: hsrv-user
    mqtt-password: sf1nE9bjPc
    username: HUB USER
    password: HUB PASSWORD
    serial: HUB SERIAL
    client: homeassistant
    scan_interval: 2
  vedo:
    host: VEDO IP ADDRESS
    port: 80
    password: VEDO PASSWORD
    scan_interval: 30

```
### How to find the hub serial?

#### Comelit app
- Open the Comelit app
- Scan for a new hub device
- Copy the serial

For more information, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/gicamm/homeassistant-comelit/wiki).

### Supported features
- Lights
- Shutters
- Energy Production
- Energy Consumption
- Temperature/Humidity
- Automation
- Scenario
- Alarm

The integration also exports the alarm sensor as a presence detector. 
It allows presence-based lights, scenes, and so on.


#### Comelit scenario
The integration supports the comelit scenario. It exports the scenario as a scene. 
A scene can be useful for exporting some VIP features (such as open the door) which, otherwise, 
cannot be fully reachable through the Hub.
